--- MESH DIMENSIONS (from glTF) ---
Width (X):     4.0 m
Height (Y):    4.0 m  
Thickness (Z): 0.04 m (40mm)

--- ORIENTATION CHECKS ---
✓ PASS: Thickness (Z) is thin (0.04m < 0.1m threshold)
✓ PASS: Width (X) > Thickness (Z)  (4.0m > 0.04m)
✓ PASS: Height (Y) > Thickness (Z) (4.0m > 0.04m)

--- Z-FORWARD STANDARD COMPLIANCE ---
✓ PASS: Wall is wider (X-axis) than it is thick (Z-axis)
✓ PASS: Wall is taller (Y-axis) than it is thick (Z-axis)
✓ PASS: Dimensions follow expected pattern for thin wall panel

--- BOUNDING BOX ---
Min: (-2.0, -2.0, -0.02)
Max: ( 2.0,  2.0,  0.02)

This means the wall:
- Extends from -2m to +2m on X-axis (4m wide) ✓
- Extends from -2m to +2m on Y-axis (4m tall) ✓
- Extends from -0.02m to +0.02m on Z-axis (0.04m thick) ✓
- Is centered at origin (0, 0, 0) ✓

--- COMPARISON TO EXPECTED ---
Expected: ~4m × ~4m × ~0.1m
Actual:    4m × 4m × 0.04m

Note: Thickness is 0.04m instead of 0.1m, which is even thinner.
This is ACCEPTABLE and may look better visually.

--- GODOT IMPORT EXPECTATIONS ---
When imported into Godot with -Z Forward export setting:
- Front face should point toward -Z (forward in Godot)
- Width spans X-axis (left-right)
- Height spans Y-axis (up-down)
- Thickness minimal along Z-axis

--- OVERALL VERDICT ---
✅ CORRECT: Wall dimensions are properly oriented for Z-Forward standard

The wall should now:
1. Appear as a thin panel (not a cube)
2. Stand upright in the hexagonal room
3. Not require additional rotations in Godot
4. Face inward correctly when positioned around the hexagon

--- NEXT STEPS ---
1. Open Godot editor to trigger auto-reimport
2. Check the wall in the scene (should be thin panels now)
3. Run project to verify visual appearance
4. Check debug logs after running to confirm AABB matches these values
